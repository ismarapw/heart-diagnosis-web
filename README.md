# Heart Diagnosis Web App
Hello there, welcome to my repository! This project is for implementing Machine Learning Model that i've done. The aim of this project is to make a website that can predict user's heart wheteher healthy or not. You can check my repo [here](https://github.com/ismarapw/heart-disease-prediction) to elaborate how i got the model. Basically this website will ask you for several quiestion and the model will predict based on your answer. 

# Key Points
1. Implemented flask as an inference process.
2. Used JavaScript Fetch API to get the prediction.
3. Implemented Single Page Application.

# Usage and Installation
You can use this repository by clone it and make sure you have installed python (3.11) in your machine. Don't forget to make your python environment and install all the requirements.txt.
```bash
python -m venv env # Create env

env\Scripts\activate # Activing env

```

To run the website you can run the python file (run.py).

```
